# Prompt

Hey Claude. Your task here is to create a beautiful landing page for this application. The application is described in details in project.md.

It needs to be a marvel and make people think that the team building it is not one person, but instead a team of designers entirely. Push the limits of design in your proposal.

Initialize the repository with:

- Vite
- Tailwind
- pnpm
- TS
- React

Once it's initialized, create 5 designs in page /1 to /5. They should be wildly different and avoid repetition from each design.

Use all skills and MCP available to you to help in the task, especially frontend design skill. Go!
